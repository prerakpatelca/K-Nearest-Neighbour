# K-Nearest-Neighbour
Obtained some machine learning data for classification, test several versions of the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm using that data, and then wrote a short report on the findings. In Assignment 2A, wrote a code and tested your own version of K-Nearest Neighbour.

This is a python program where we are reading CSV file with the dataset of Breast Cancer with label of Benign or Malignant and features attached with it. We are shuffling the data set and we will use first 75% of the data set in training set and other 25% of the data set in testing data. We use this data to plot scatter plots for three pairs of the features. Next, we are plotting the bar chart for the frequency of the labels.
